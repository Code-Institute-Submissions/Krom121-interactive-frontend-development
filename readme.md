### Tech Used

    Html 5 for the structure of the page.

    Bootstrap css was used for layout purposes.

    Css was used for some styling.

    D3.js version 5 was used for the visualisation of the data.

    Csv files where used to store the data. Which I had created in Excel.

    Data Array with json format was used inside the pie chart.

### Unit Testing

 Manual testing was performed on all the graphs.

 Bugs where fixed where changes where made from the different versions of d3.js.

 ### Credit 

 I referenced d3.js.org documentation

 ### Etra Notes

 I will be taking a seperate course on d3.js that goes deeper into d3.js. To help my understanding of d3.js.

 I do enjoy Data Visualisation though I know may take little more time for me.
