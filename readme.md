## Tech Used

    Html 5 for the structure of the page.

    Bootstrap css was used for layout purposes.

    Css was used for some custom styling.

    D3.js version 5.15.0 was used for the visualisation of the data.

    Csv files where used to store the data.

    Api's where used to deliver data of bitcoin to line chart.

### Unit Testing

 Manual testing was performed on all the graphs.

 Bugs where fixed where changes where made from the different versions of d3.js. Using developer inspect tool in google.

### Credit

 I referenced d3.js.org documentation

### Etra Notes

 I will be taking a seperate course on d3.js that goes deeper into d3.js. To help my understanding of d3.js.

 I do enjoy Data Visualisation though I know may take little more time for me.
